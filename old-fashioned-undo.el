;;; NOTE
;;
;; This library is just tested on Emacs 24.3.1 on Ubuntu 10.04
;; and Mac OS X 10.8.3, and won't be run with any version of XEmacs.

;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Overview
;; ========
;;
;; This library provides minor mode `old-fashioned-undo-mode' which
;; makes `undo' and `redo' command working in an old fashioned way.
;;
;; The default `undo/redo' commands provided by emacs records each 
;; `undo/redo' operations on `buffer-undo-list'. This behavior may
;; make undo/redo operations perfect, but I feel this behavior is
;; too much verbose and little bit annoying.
;;
;; The undo/redo command provided this library never records
;; `undo/redo' operation on `buffer-undo-list' so that we can
;; `undo/redo' in intuitive way.
;;
;; Additionally, while `old-fashioned-undo-mode' is on, the number
;; of pending `undo/redo' operation will be displayed in the
;; minibuffer when each `undo/redo' command is executed.
;;
;;
;; INSTALLING
;; ==========
;; To install this library, save this file to a directory in your
;; `load-path' (you can view the current `load-path' using "C-h v
;; load-path RET" within Emacs), then add the following line to your
;; .emacs startup file:
;;
;;    (require 'old-fashioned-undo)
;;    (old-fashioned-undo-mode t)
;;
;;
;; USING
;; =====
;; To toggle old-fashioned-undo feature, just type:
;;
;;   `M-x old-fashioned-undo-mode RET'
;;
;;
;; Key map Examples
;; ================
;; (global-set-key [(control z)] 'undo)
;; (global-set-key [(control Z)] 'redo)
;;
;;
;; KNOWN PROBLEMS
;; ==============
;; - Cursor position won't be set properly after undo/redo when cua-mode
;;   is on.

;;; Change Log:
;; v6.0 04/04/2013  Renamed to `old-fashioned-undo.el'.
;; v5.2 02/04/2012  Fixed compiler errors.
;;                  Fixed errors which occurs to XEmacs.
;; v5.1 12/27/2010  Fixed compiler errors and a typo.
;; v5.0 11/19/2010  Renamed to `linear-undo.el'.
;;                  Heavily arranged codes.
;;                  Moved repository from subversion to git.
;; v4.0 10/14/2010  Moved codes regarding to highlighting modified text to
;;                  new library `volatile-highlights.el'.
;; v3.1 10/17/2003  Arranged name of functions and variables.
;;                  (No bug fix and new feature.)
;; v3.0 10/12/2003  emacs21 support.
;; v2.7 10/07/2001  Fixed a bug that undo/redo elements is not counted properly
;;                  when saving information exists in the buffer-undo/redo-list.
;; v2.6 10/06/2001  Fixed a bug that highlights are not removed when frame
;;                  is switched just after undo/redo command.
;;                  (Just make 'old-fashioned-undo/buffer-highlight-list' global variable.)
;; v2.5 10/05/2001  Made optional variable customizable.
;;                  I think all of the feature, that I wanted when I started
;;                  to write this library, are implemented in this version.
;; v2.4 10/05/2001  Inhibit unintended cursor movement by undo/redo.
;; v2.3 10/05/2001  Remove highlights automatically.
;; v2.2 10/04/2001  Display count of undo/redo elements which remains in
;;                  buffer-undo/redo-list.
;;                  New option `allow-remove-boundary-p'.
;;                  Fixed a few bugs.
;; v2.1 10/04/2001  New function 'old-fashioned-undo/lst/get-next'.
;;                  (to prepare for implementing new feature, counting
;;                   undo/redo elements in buffer-undo/redo-list.)
;;                  Fixed a few bugs.
;; v2.0 10/03/2001  Highlight text which is inserted by undo/redo command.
;;                  (very experimental)
;;                  Codes are heavily modified.
;; v1.2 10/02/2001  Fixed some bugs.
;; v1.1 09/29/2001  Menu-bar support.
;; v1.0 09/28/2001  Initial version.
